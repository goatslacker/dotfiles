" Version: 1.0
"
" Description:
"
"   This is a very simple plugin that allows for directory tree-specific vim
"   settings.  For every file edited, it searches upward from that file's
"   directory for a file named '.vimdir' and sources it.

" Define a group so we can delete them when this file is sourced, and we don't
" end up with multiple autocmd entries if this file is sourced more than once.
